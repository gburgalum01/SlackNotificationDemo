# SlackNotificationDemo

## Overview

This project is a small Java application that demonstrates how to interact with the Slack API in order to send a message to a user.

## Prerequisites

In addition to creating a Slack account and workspace, you will need to create a app for your workspace.  

Once an app is created, you can use the Bot User OAuth Token to allow this application to invoke the Slack API via the configured Slack app.

See https://api.slack.com/apps for more information.

## Usage

java SlackNotificationDemo `<bot token`> `<user e-mail address`> `<message>`
